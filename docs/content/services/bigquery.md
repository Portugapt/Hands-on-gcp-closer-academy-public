## History

BigQuery was announced in 2011 and made generally available in 2012. It was developed by Google engineers who were working on the Google Analytics platform. The goal of BigQuery was to create a cloud-based data warehouse that would be able to handle the massive amounts of data that Google Analytics was generating.

BigQuery is a serverless data warehouse, which means that you don't have to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. You simply upload your data to BigQuery and then run queries against it. BigQuery uses a distributed computing architecture to process queries, which allows it to scale to handle very large datasets.

BigQuery is also a cost-effective data warehouse. You only pay for the data that you store and the queries that you run. This makes it a good choice for businesses that need to store and analyze large amounts of data, but don't want to spend a lot of money on a traditional data warehouse.

BigQuery has been used by a variety of businesses, including Netflix, Coca-Cola, and the US Department of Defense. It is a popular choice for businesses that need to store and analyze large amounts of data quickly and cost-effectively.

Here are some of the key milestones in the history of BigQuery:

- 2011: BigQuery is announced at the Google Cloud Next conference.
- 2012: BigQuery is made generally available.
- 2013: BigQuery adds support for the BigQuery ML machine learning engine.
- 2014: BigQuery adds support for the BigQuery BI Engine, which allows users to run interactive queries against BigQuery data.
- 2015: BigQuery adds support for the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, which makes it easier to load data into BigQuery from a variety of sources.
- 2016: BigQuery adds support for the BigQuery Data Studio, which is a cloud-based data visualization tool.
- 2017: BigQuery adds support for the BigQuery Data Fusion, which is a fully managed, cloud native ETL service.
- 2018: BigQuery adds support for the BigQuery Federated Data Access, which allows users to query data that is stored in other data warehouses.
- 2019: BigQuery adds support for the BigQuery Omni, which is a fully managed, cloud native data lakehouse.
- 2020: BigQuery adds support for the BigQuery Geospatial Engine, which allows users to run geospatial queries against BigQuery data.
- 2021: BigQuery adds support for the BigQuery ML Engine Pipelines, which makes it easier to build and deploy machine learning pipelines.

BigQuery is a continually evolving platform, and new features are being added all the time. It is a powerful tool for businesses that need to store and analyze large amounts of data.

## Features

- Scalability: BigQuery uses a distributed computing architecture to process queries, which allows it to scale to handle very large datasets. The maximum size of a BigQuery table is 10 petabytes.
- Cost-effectiveness: You only pay for the data that you store and the queries that you run. There are no upfront costs or commitments.
- Performance: BigQuery can process queries very quickly, even on large datasets. The average query latency is less than 1 second.
- Flexibility: BigQuery supports a variety of data formats, including CSV, JSON, and Avro. It can be used to analyze a wide variety of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- Security: BigQuery is a secure platform that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes. It is compliant with a variety of industry standards, including HIPAA and GDPR.
- Integrations: BigQuery integrates with other Google Cloud Platform services, such as Cloud Dataproc and Cloud Dataflow. This makes it easy to build and deploy data pipelines that can process data from a variety of sources.
- Machine learning: BigQuery has built-in machine learning capabilities that can be used to analyze data and extract insights. This can be used for tasks such as fraud detection, customer segmentation, and product recommendations.
