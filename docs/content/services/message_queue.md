# Publisher-Subscriber and Pub/Sub

## What is the Publisher-Subscriber pattern?

    The publisher-subscriber (pub-sub) messaging pattern is a communication paradigm where messages are sent by publishers to multiple subscribers, without requiring direct connections between them. Publishers broadcast messages to topics, and subscribers listen to topics they are interested in. This pattern provides a decoupled architecture, allowing for scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance. Subscribers receive messages asynchronously, enabling them to process events independently, without blocking or waiting for other subscribers. The pub-sub pattern is widely used in distributed systems, event-driven architectures, and messaging applications.

## What is Google Pub/Sub?

    Google Pub/Sub is a real-time messaging service based on the publisher-subscriber pattern, designed for Google Cloud Platform. It enables reliable, scalable, and asynchronous event-driven communication between microservices, applications, and data streams, promoting decoupled and flexible architectures.
